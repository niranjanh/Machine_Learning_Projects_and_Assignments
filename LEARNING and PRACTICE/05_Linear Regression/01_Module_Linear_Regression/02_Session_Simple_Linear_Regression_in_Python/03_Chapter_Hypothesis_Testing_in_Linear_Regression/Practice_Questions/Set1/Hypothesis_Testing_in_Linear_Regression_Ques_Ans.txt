QUESTION 1:

Hypothesis Test
What does it mean if you fail to reject the Null hypothesis in the case of simple linear regression?

ANS:

β1 and thus, the independent variable it is associated with is insignificant in the prediction of the dependent variable. 

Feedback :
Correct! The Null Hypothesis in simple linear regression is:

β1 = 0

Thus, if we fail to reject the Null hypothesis, it means that 
β1 is indeed zero, and thus insignificant for the prediction of the independent variable.


QUESTION 2:

P-value
Which of the following is used to calculate the p-value for a particular beta coefficient?


ANS:

The t-statistic of the beta coefficient

Feedback :
The t-statistic along with the t-distribution table is used to determine the p-value of the coefficient.


QUESTION 3:

Distribution of the Error Terms
If the sample size is small, i.e. less than 30, which of the following distribution is used to describe the error terms?

ANS:

T-distribution

Feedback :
Correct! In case of a small sample size, we use a t-distribution which is very similar to a normal distribution.



QUESTION 4:

T-score
Suppose that for a linear model, you got β1 as 0.5. 
Also, the standard error of 
β1 was found out to be 0.02. What will be the value of t-score for β1?


ANS:

25

Feedback :
Recall that the t-score for 
β1 is given as 

β1/SE(β1).

Hence, you have:

t-score = 0.5/0.02 = 25




QUESTION 5:

Significance of Beta
From the t-score you got in the previous question, what can you say about the significance of β1?


ANS:

β1 is significant.

Feedback :
Correct! Recall that a t-distribution is very similar to a normal distribution. And a value as big as 25 means a practically zero p-value which in turn means that the variable is significant. You can have a look at the t-table here anyway. And you'll anyway see this in the Python demo in the next segment.
