QUESTION 1:

Residual Analysis
Plotting a histogram of the residuals helps you determine: (More than one option may be correct.).


ANS:


A.
If the error terms are normally distributed

Feedback :
Correct! A histogram of the error terms is plotted to check if the error terms are normally distributed.


B.
If the error terms are centred around zero

Feedback :
Correct! While the histogram tells you whether the error terms are normally distributed or not, it also helps you check if they are centred around zero which is quite crucial.







QUESTION 2:

Model Comparison using RMSE
You fit two linear regression models for the same data, where the first one gives an RMSE value of 3.78, and the second returns a value of 6.33. Which of these is a better model?


ANS:

The first one

Feedback :
Yes! Recall that RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is a metric that tells you the deviation of the predicted values by a model from the actual observed values. So, since it is a sort of error term, it is better to have a low RMSE.

Notice that the RMSE for the first model is lesser than the second model. So naturally, this model would be better than the other.








QUESTION 3:

Model Comparison using R-squared
For the two linear regression models mentioned in the last question, the R-squared values in the train and test sets are as follows:

Model		R-squared (on train set)	R-squared (on test set)
First Model	0.85				0.61
Second Model	0.74				0.72
 

Which of these do you think is a better model?


ANS:

The second model

Feedback :
The second model seems to be a better one because even though the R-squared for the first model is quite good on the train set, but it drops tremendously in the test set. This simply means that the first model is not generalising well whereas in the case of the second model we have decent and close values of R-squared for both the train and test sets.
