QUESTION 1:

Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression
What will be the effect of the error terms not being homoscedastic in nature?

ANS:

The inferences made on the model would be unreliable.

Feedback :
Yes! Even if you fit a line through the data, you cannot make inferences about the model. The parameters used to make inferences (which you will study in later segments) will become highly unreliable.
