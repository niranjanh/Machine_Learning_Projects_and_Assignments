QUESTION 1:

Viewing the coefficients
Which of the following commands can be used to view 
β0 and β1 
once you have fitted the line using statsmodels? The name of your linear regression object is lr. (More than one option(s) may be correct.)


ANS:

1. lr.params

Feedback :
Yes! You can view both the parameters using this simple command.


2. lr .summary()

Feedback :
The summary() function also output the values of coefficients and hence, can be used to view these values as well.



QUESTION 2:

Looking at the following summary statistic, what can be said about the significance of the overall model fit?

ANS:

The overall model fit is significant

Feedback :
Correct! If you look at the summary statistics, you can see that the F-statistic has a value of 270.2 which is a very high value and this, the Prob(F-statistic) is 5.93e-56 (as shown in the table) which is a practically zero value. Hence, the value of less than 0.05 which means that the overall model fit is significant.


QUESTION 3:

What can you say about the significance of the coefficient the variable 'Frequency'?

ANS:

The p-value of the coefficient for frequency is low and hence, it is significant.

Feedback :
Correct! If you look at the table, you can see that the p-value for the coefficient of the variable 'Frequency' is 0 which is a low value and hence, the coefficient is significant.



QUESTION 4:

Finally, looking at the following summary statistics, what can you say about the extent of fit, i.e. the variance explanatory power of the model?


ANS:


The R-squared value is low and hence, the model doesn't explain much of the variance.

Feedback :
Correct! Look at the summary statistics closely. The value of R-squared is 0.153. Recall that R-squared varies from 0 to 1 wherein a value of 0 implies that none of the variance in the data is explained and a value of 1 implies that all of the variance in the data is explained. Can you answer the question now? Hence, a value of 0.153 is a low value of R-squared which in turn implies that the model doesn't explain much variance present in the data.
