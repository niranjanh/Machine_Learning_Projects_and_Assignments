QUESTION 1:

Strength of Relationship
Which of the following is indicative of a strong relationship between X and y?

OPTIONS:

A.
The value of β1 as obtained after fitting the model is 0.95


B.
The correlation coefficient between X and y is 0.95

C.
The p-value for the coefficient is 0.95


D.
Both A and B


ANS:

B.

The correlation coefficient between X and y is 0.95

Feedback :
The correlation coefficient specifies how strong is the relationship between two variables. And in this case, the value is 0.95 which is quite high indicating a strong relationship between X and y.







QUESTION 2:

Hypothesis Testing for Betas
In order to determine whether the coefficient in a simple linear regression model is significant or not, which Null Hypothesis do we propose?

ANS:

β1 = 0

Feedback :
Correct! The Null Hypothesis in the case of simple linear regression is indeed:

β1 = 0

This is kept so because in case that the Null hypothesis is rejected, you can conclude that 
β1 is not zero and the coefficient is significant, but if we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, the coefficient is deemed insignificant.






QUESTION 3:

Overall Model Fit

Which metric is used to determine the significance of the overall model fit?


OPTIONS:

A.
T-statistic

B.
R-squared

C.
F-statistic

D.
Both B & C



ANS:

C.
F-statistic

Feedback :
Correct! The F-statistic tells whether the overall model fit is significant or not.








QUESTION 4:

Fitting a line using statsmodels
Why do you add a constant to the train set using the sm.add_constant() command, when you’re fitting a line using statsmodels?


ANS:

statsmodels fits a line passing through the origin by default.

Feedback :
Correct! By default, statsmodels fits a line passing through the origin, i.e. it doesn't fit an intercept. Hence, you need to use the command 'add_constant' so that it also fits an intercept.
