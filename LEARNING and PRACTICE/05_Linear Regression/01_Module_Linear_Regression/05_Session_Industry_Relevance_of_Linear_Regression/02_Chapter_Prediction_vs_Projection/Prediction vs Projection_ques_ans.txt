Prediction vs Projection

QUESTION 1:

Projection
Which of the following are true in case of projection?

OPTIONS:

A.
Projection focuses on the identification of variables that are important in explaining the outcome, rather than how good the final outcome is

B.
While making a projection, it is assumed that the conditions in which the model was built continue to be the same

C.
It is better to get a simple model with lower accuracy than a complex model with high accuracy

D.
The accuracy of the final outcome is more important than the identification of the most important driver variables


ANS:

B.
While making a projection, it is assumed that the conditions in which the model was built continue to be the same
Feedback :
Forecast assumes that conditions remain the same as they were when the model was built.


D.
The accuracy of the final outcome is more important than the identification of the most important driver variables
Feedback :
While making a projection, the aim is accuracy. Thus, a complex model containing a large number of variables, with high accuracy is more valuable than a simple model with lower accuracy.
