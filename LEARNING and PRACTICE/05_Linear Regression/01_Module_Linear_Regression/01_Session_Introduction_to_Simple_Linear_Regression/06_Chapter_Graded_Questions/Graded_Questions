Question 1:

Machine Learning Models
A Singapore-based startup Healin launched an app called JustShakeIt, which enables a user to send an emergency alert to emergency contacts and/or caregivers simply by shaking the phone with one hand. The program uses a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between actual emergency shakes and everyday jostling, using data with labels.

What kind of problem is this?

ANS:

Supervised learning-Classification

Feedback :
The algorithm has to distinguish between actual emergency shakes and everyday jostling. Here, your output variable has predefined labels (shake/jostle), which are categorical in nature. So, this is a supervised learning-classification problem.


QUESION 2:

Regression in Machine Learning
Select all the tasks where linear regression algorithm can be applied.


OPTIONS:

A:
You have a dataset of BMI (body mass index) and the fat percentage of the customers of a fitness centre. Now, the fitness centre wants to predict the fat percentage of a new customer, given his BMI.

B:
You have collected data from a house rental website like commonfloor.com. The data has the rental prices of apartments and customer ratings as HIGH or LOW. You want to predict the customer rating, given the rental price of a new house.

C:
You want to predict the sales of a retail store based on its size, given the dataset of sales of retail stores and their sizes.

D:
You want to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the telecom network.


ANS:

A and C are correct

A:

You have a dataset of BMI (body mass index) and the fat percentage of the customers of a fitness centre. Now, the fitness centre wants to predict the fat percentage of a new customer, given his BMI.

Feedback :
Here, the output variable (dependent variable, which is to be predicted) is the fat percentage, which is a numeric variable. So, this is a regression task.


C:

You want to predict the sales of a retail store based on its size, given the dataset of sales of retail stores and their sizes.

Feedback :
Here, the output variable (dependent variable, which is to be predicted) is sales, which is a numeric variable. So, this is a regression task.




QUESTION 3:

Coefficients of Regression Equation

The independent variable X from a linear regression is measured in miles. If you convert it to kilometres (keeping the unit of the dependent variable Y the same), how will the slope coefficient change? (Note: 1 mile = 1.6 km)


OPTIONS:

A:  It will get multiplied by 1.6.


B:  It will get divided by 1.6.


C:  It will remain the same.


D:  Cannot say.



ANS:

B:
It will get divided by 1.6.

Feedback :
In the linear regression equation, X gets multiplied by 1.6 with no change in Y. So, the slope will be divided by 1.6.




QUESTION 4:


Strength of the Regression Model
You want to find the linear relation between the number of X-ray machines purchased at one time and the cost per machine. The following data has been obtained on the same:

X: Number of machines purchased		1	3	6	10	15
Y: Cost per widget (in thousand rupees)	89	85	79	73	64

Suppose the R² between X and Y is 0.87. Which of the following conclusions can you draw from this?


OPTIONS:

A:
The linear relation between X and Y is weak, and their correlation will be positive.


B:
The linear relation between X and Y is weak, and their correlation will be negative.


C:
The linear relation between X and Y is strong, and their correlation will be positive.


D:
The linear relation between X and Y is strong, and their correlation will be negative.



ANS:

D:
The linear relation between X and Y is strong, and their correlation will be negative.

Feedback :
A higher value of R² means a strong linear relation. As Y is decreasing with the increasing value of X, you can conclude that their correlation will be negative.
