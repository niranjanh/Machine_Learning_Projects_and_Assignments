Question 1:

Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)

Find the value of RSS for this regression line.

ANS:

6.25

Feedback :

The residuals for all 5 points are -0.5, 1, 0, -2, 1. The sum of squares of all 5 residuals would be 0.25 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 6.25



Question 2:

Total Sum of Errors (TSS)

Find the value of TSS for this regression line.


ANS:

14

Feedback :

The average of y-value for all data points (3 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 8)/5 = 25/5 = 5. 
So  (y − ybar) term for each data point would be -2, 0, 0, -1, 3. So, the squared sum of these terms would be 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 9 = 14.


QUESTION 3:

R²


The RSS for this example comes out to be 6.25 and the TSS comes out to be 14.

What would be the R² for this regression line?

ANS:

1 - (6.25/14)

Feedback :

R² value is given by 1 - (RSS / TSS). So, in this case, R² value would be 1 - (6.25 / 14).
