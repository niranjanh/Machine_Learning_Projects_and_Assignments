Question 1:

Intercept of a Straight Line
What is the intercept of the given line? Use the graph given above to answer this question.

Ans: 3

The value of y when x = 0 in the given straight line is 3. So, 3 would be the intercept in this case.



Question 2:

Slope of a Straight Line
What is the slope of the given line? Use the graph given above to answer this question.

Ans: 1/2

The slope of any straight line can be calculated by (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁), where (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) are any two points through which the given line passes. This line passes (0,3) and (2, 4); so the slope of this line would be (4-3/2-0) = ½.




Question 3:

Equation of a Straight Line
What would be the equation of the given line?

Ans: Y = X/2 + 3

The standard equation of a straight line is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the intercept. In this case, m = ½ and c = 3, so equation would be Y = X/2 + 3.
