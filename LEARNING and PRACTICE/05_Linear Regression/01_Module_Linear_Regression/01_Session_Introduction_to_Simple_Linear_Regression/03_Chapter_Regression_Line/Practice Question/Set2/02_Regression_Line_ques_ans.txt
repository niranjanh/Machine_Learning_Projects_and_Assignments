Question 1:

Coefficients of Regression Line
Which statement explains the physical interpretation of the intercept of the regression line Y = β₀ + β₁.X, where Y is the sales amount in crores and X is the marketing spend in lakhs?


Ans:

When the amount spent on marketing is Rs. 0, the sales amount = β₀ crore

For this regression line, β₀ is the intercept and β₁ is the slope. The value of Y (sales amount) is β₀ crore when the value of X (marketing spend) is Rs. 0.




Question 2:

Coefficients of Regression Line
Which statement explains the physical interpretation of the slope of the regression line Y = β₀ + β₁.X, where Y is the sales amount in crores and X is the marketing spend in lakhs?


Ans:

For each additional 1 lakh spent on marketing, the predicted sales increases by β₁ crore

Feedback :
For this regression line, β₀ is the intercept and β₁ is the slope. For a unit increase in the quantity of X (marketing spend), Y (sales amount) increases by β₁.1 = β₁ units.
