Question 1:

Least Squares Regression Line

The coefficients of the least squares regression line are determined by the Ordinary Least Squares method â€” which basically means minimising the sum of the squares of the:

Ans:

y-coordinates of actual data - y-coordinates of predicted data

The Ordinary Least Squares method has the criterion of the minimisation of the sum of squares of residuals. Residuals are defined as the difference between the y-coordinates of actual data and the y-coordinates of predicted data.



Question 2:

Best Fit Regression Line
What is the main criterion used to determine the best-fitting regression line?

Ans:

The line that minimises the sum of squares of distances of points from the regression line

The criterion is given by the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which states that the sum of squares of residuals should be minimum. This is explained by this option.
