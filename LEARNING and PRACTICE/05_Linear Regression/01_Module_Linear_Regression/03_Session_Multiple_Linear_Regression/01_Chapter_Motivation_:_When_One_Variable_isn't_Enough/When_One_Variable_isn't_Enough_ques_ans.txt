QUESTION 1:

R-squared
In the simple linear regression model between TV and sales, the accuracy, or the 'model fit', as measured by R-squared was about 0.81. But, when you brought in the radio and the newspaper variables along with TV, the R-squared increased to 0.91 and 0.83, respectively. Do you think the R-squared value will always increase (or at least remain the same) when you add more variables?

ANS:

Yes

Feedback :
The R-squared will always either increase or remain the same when you add more variables. Because you already have the predictive power of the previous variable so the R-squared value can definitely not go down. And a new variable, no matter how insignificant it might be, cannot decrease the value of R-squared.



QUESTION 2:


Assumptions of multiple linear regression
Which of the following assumptions changes for multiple linear regression?

OPTIONS:

A.
The error terms should be normally distributed.

B.
The error terms are centred at zero.

C.
The error terms have constant variance.

D.
None of the above.

ANS:

D.
None of the above.

Feedback :
Correct! None of the above assumptions changes when moving from simple to multiple linear regression.

ANS:

D.
None of the above.

Feedback :
Correct! None of the above assumptions changes when moving from simple to multiple linear regression.
