QUESTION 1:

Graded Questions
An analyst observes a positive relationship between digital marketing expenses and online sales for a firm. However, she intuitively feels that she should add an additional predictor variable, one which has a high correlation with marketing expenses.

If the analyst adds this independent variable to the model, which of the following could happen? More than one choices could be correct.

OPTIONS:

A.
The model’s R-squared will decrease

B.
The model’s adjusted R-squared could decrease

C.
The Beta-coefficient for predictor - digital marketing expenses, will remain same

D.
The relationship between marketing expenses and sales can become insignificant



ANS:

B.
The model’s adjusted R-squared could decrease

Feedback :
Adjusted R-squared could decrease if the variable does not add much to the model, to explain Online Sales.


D.
The relationship between marketing expenses and sales can become insignificant

Feedback :
The relation between marketing expenses and sales can become insignificant with the addition of a new variable.

QUESTION 2:

Suppose you need to build a model on a data set which contains 2 categorical variables with 2 and 4 levels respectively. How many dummy variables should you create for model building?

ANS:

4

Feedback :
Since n-1 dummy variables can be used to describe a variable with n levels, you will get 1 dummy variable for the variable with two levels, and 3 dummy variables for the variable with 4 levels.

QUESTION 3:

Redundant Variables
If one of the feature variables say, A is being explained well by some of the other feature variables, this would mean that the variable A has:

ANS:

A high VIF

Feedback :
Correct! If the feature variable A is being well explained by the other feature variables, this would mean that A has a high VIF. This is also evident from the formula for VIF: 
1/(1−R2i).

Now, if A is being explained by some of the other feature variables, this would mean that the R-squared value is pretty high, which would make the denominator which is (1−R2i) very low, which again, in turn, would make the VIF value high.
