QUESTION 1:


Dummy Variables
Suppose you have 'n' categorical variables, each with 'm' levels. How many dummy variables would you need to represent all the levels of all the categorical variables?

ANS:

(m-1) * n

Feedback :
Each of the dummy variables has 'm' levels. So to represent one categorical variable, you would require (m-1) levels. Hence, to represent 'n' categorical variables, you would need (m-1)*n dummy variables.




QUESTION 2:

Automated Feature Selection
Which of the following is/are an example of an automated approach for linear regression?

ANS:

A.
Recursive Feature Elimination

B.
Stepwise Selection using AIC

C.
Regularisation




QUESTION 3:

Redundant Variables
After performing inferences on a linear model built with several variables, you concluded that the variable ‘r’ was almost being described by other feature variables. This meant that the variable ‘r’:

ANS:

Had a high VIF

Feedback :
Correct! If the variable is being described well by the rest of the feature variables, it means it has a high VIF meaning it is redundant in the presence of the other variables.
