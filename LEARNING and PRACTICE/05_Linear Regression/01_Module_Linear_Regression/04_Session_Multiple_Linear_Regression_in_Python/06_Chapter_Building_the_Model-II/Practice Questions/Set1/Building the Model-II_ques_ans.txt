Elimination based on VIF
Suppose the VIFs obtained for five different variables are as follows:

X1	7.12
X2	5.53
X3	5.01
X4	3.45
X5	2.68
 

Assuming that youâ€™re dropping variables only on the basis of VIF and a VIF > 5 is not acceptable, which of these variables will you definitely drop?


OPTIONS:


A.
X1

B.
X2

C.
X1 and X2

D.
X1, X2, and X3


ANS:

A.
X1

Feedback :
Correct. It is always advisable that you drop variables one by one. Now, this variable definitely has a high VIF and needs to be dropped. The other two variables X2 and X3 also have a VIF > 5, but it might happen that after you drop X1, their VIF values will drop. So never drop more than one variable at a time.
