Question 1:


Consider a function  f (x,y)= (x-y-1)^2 + (3x-2y-1)^2. Answer the following questions (which are steps to minimise a cost function) and finally obtain the minimum value of the function f(x,y).

Select the correct function g(x,y) obtained by differentiating f(x,y) w.r.t x.

Ans:
2(10x-7y-4)

Steps:

Do the differentiation wrt x


Question 2:

Differentiation w.r.t y

Consider a function f (x,y)= (x-y-1)^2 + (3x-2y-1)^2 . Answer the following questions (which are steps to minimise a cost function) and finally obtain the minimum value of the function f (x,y).

Select the correct function h(x,y) obtained by differentiating f (x,y) w.r.t y.

Ans:
2(-7x+5y+3)

Steps:

Do the differentiation wrt y




Question 3:

Simultaneous Equations
Find out the values of x and y obtained by equating g(x,y) = 2(10x-7y-4) and h(x,y) = 2(-7x+5y+3) to 0 and solving the linear equations.

Ans:

x=-1, y=-2




Question 4:

Minimum Value

Substituting the values of x and y obtained in the previous questions, find the minimum value of f (x,y)= (x-y-1)^2 + (3x-2y-1)^2.

Ans:

0
