QUESTION 1:

TPR and FPR
Given the following confusion matrix, calculate the value of True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).

Actual/Predicted	Not Churn	Churn
Not Churn		300		200
Churn			100		400

ANS:

TPR = 80%

FPR = 40%

Feedback :
Correct! Recall the formulas for TPR and FPR were:

TPR =TP/TP+FN

FPR=FP/FP+TN

Here,

TP = 400; FN = 100; FP = 200; TN = 300

Hence, you get -

TPR=400/400+100
=80%

FPR=200/200+300
=40%

QUESTION 2:

True Positive Rate
You have the following table showcasing the actual 'Churn' labels and the predicted probabilities for 5 customers.

 

Customer	Churn	Predicted Churn Probability
Thulasi		1	0.52
Aditi		0	0.56
Jaideep		1	0.78
Ashok		0	0.45
Amulya		0	0.22
 

Calculate the True Positive Rate and False Positive rate for the cutoffs of 0.4 and 0.5. Which of these cutoffs, will give you a better model?

Note: The good model is the one in which TPR is high and FPR is low.

ANS:


Cutoff of 0.5

Feedback :
Now, at the cutoff of 0.4, you get the following values of predicted probabilities: 

Customer	Churn	Predicted Churn Probability	Predicted Churn Label
Thulasi		1	0.52				1
Aditi		0	0.56				1
Jaideep		1	0.78				1
Ashok		0	0.45				1
Amulya		0	0.22				0
 

From the above table, you can easily calculate:

True Positives = 2

False Positives = 2

Also, from the original table, you have:

Actual Positives = 2

Actual Negatives = 3

Hence, you get:

TPR  = 2/2 = 100%

FPR = 2/3 = 67%

Performing similar steps for a cutoff of 0.5 will give you -

TPR=100%

FPRâ‰ˆ33%

(Do calculate it yourself to verify)

As you can see, with both the cutoffs, the TPR is 100% but for the cutoff 0f 0.5 you have a lower value of FPR. So clearly, a cutoff of 0.5 gives you a better model.

Please note that 0.5 just gives the better model among 0.4 and 0.5. It might be possible that there is a cutoff point which gives an even better model.

QUESTION 3:

Area Under the Curve
You have the following five AUCs (Area under the curve) for ROCs plotted for five different models. Which of these models is the best?



Model	AUC
A	0.54
B	0.82
C	0.79
D	0.66
E	0.56

ANS:

B

Feedback :
Correct!

Recall that when the ROC curve is more towards the top left corner of the graph, the model is deemed to be more accurate. Hence, a greater area under the curve would mean the model is more accurate. Among the five models given, B has the highest AUC and hence is the most accurate model. Also, note that the highest value of AUC can be 1.
