QUESTION 1:


Calculating Precision
Calculate the precision value for the following model.

Actual/Predicted	Not Churn	Churn
Not Churn			400	100
Churn				50	150


ANS:

60%

Feedback :
Correct! The formula for precision is given by:

Precision =TP/TP+FP

From the matrix given,

TP = 150

FP = 100

Hence, you get,

=150/150+100
=60%

QUESTION 2:


F1-score
There is a measure known as F1-score which essentially combines both precision and recall. It is the basically the harmonic mean of precision and recall and its formula is given by:

F = 2×precison×recall/precision+recall


The F1-score is useful when you want to look at the performance of precision and recall together.

Calculate the F1-score for the model below:

Actual/Predicted	Not Churn	Churn
Not Churn	400	100
Churn	50	150

ANS:

67%

Feedback :
Correct!

From the confusion matrix given,

TP = 150

FP = 100

FN = 50

Hence, you get -

precision
= 
0.6

Recall= 150/150+50
=0.75

So, the F1-score becomes - 

F = 2×0.6×0.75/0.6+0.75
≈66.67%
≈67%
