Choosing the Optimal Cut-off
Suppose you created a dataframe to find out the optimal cut-off point for a model you built. The dataframe looks like the following:

Threshold	Probability	Accuracy	Sensitivity	Specificity
0.0		0.0		0.21		1.00		0.00
0.1		0.1		0.39		0.96		0.22
0.2		0.2		0.56		0.88		0.49
0.3		0.3		0.59		0.81		0.53
0.4		0.4		0.62		0.78		0.63
0.5		0.5		0.74		0.73		0.74
0.6		0.6		0.81		0.64		0.79
0.7		0.7		0.78		0.42		0.83
0.8		0.8		0.63		0.21		0.92
0.9		0.9		0.56		0.03		0.98
 

Based on the table above, what will the approximate value of the optimal cut-off be?


OPTIONS:

A.
0.4

B.
0.5

C.
0.6

D.
0.7

ANS:

0.5

Feedback :
Correct! The optimal cut-off point exists where the values of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are fairly decent and almost equal. At the cut-off of 0.5, the metric values are 0.74, 0.73, and 0.74 respectively. This is the optimal value of threshold that you can have.

QUESTION 1:


Choosing a model evaluation metric
As you learnt, there is usually a trade-off between various model evaluation metrics, and you cannot maximise all of them simultaneously. For e.g., if you increase sensitivity (% of correctly predicted churns), the specificity (% of correctly predicted non-churns) will reduce. 

 

Let's say that you are building a telecom churn prediction model with the business objective that your company wants to implement an aggressive customer retention campaign to retain the 'high churn-risk' customers. This is because a competitor has launched extremely low-cost mobile plans, and you want to avoid churn as much as possible by incentivising the customers. Assume that budget is not a constraint.

 

Which of the following metrics should you choose the maximise?


OPTIONS:

A.
Accuracy

B.
Sensitivity

C.
Specificity


ANS:

B.
Sensitivity

Feedback :
Yes, high sensitivity implies that your model will correctly identify almost all customers who are likely to churn. It will do that by over-estimating the churn likelihood, i.e. it will misclassify some non-churns as churns, but that is the trade-off you need to choose rather than the opposite case (in which case you may lose some low churn risk customers to the competition).

Correct
