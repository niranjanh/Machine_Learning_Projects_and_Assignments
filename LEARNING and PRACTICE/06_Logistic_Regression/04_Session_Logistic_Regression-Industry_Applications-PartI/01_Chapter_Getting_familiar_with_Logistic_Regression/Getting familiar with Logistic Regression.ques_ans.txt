QUESTION 1:


Logistic Regression
Consider that you are working in a large manufacturing company such as “APB.” APB produces high-tech appliances to test equipment attached to planes. Most of these appliances are often used to track equipment performance on an hourly basis. This generates a high amount of performance data. For now, let's focus only on the three most critical equipment - smoking detector, oxygen balance detector and microphone. The overall data contains two types of variables:

Performance variables such as an equipment's life expectancy, rpm (speed) etc.

Environmental variables such as humidity, temperature, pressure etc.

This data was collected over the past 2 years for each piece of equipment.

In your opinion, which of the following problems, when solved using the data from above, will result in the highest business growth?

OPTIONS:

A.
Data can be used for calculating the life expectancy of the equipment.

B.
Data can be used for identifying the chances of an equipment’s failure.

C.
Data can be used for controlling the equipment's performance on a daily basis.

ANS:
