WOE = ln(good in the bucket/Total Good)  − ln(bad in the bucket Total bad)

WOE = ln(Percentage of Good in bucket/Percentage of bad in the bucket)


IV = WOE ∗ ((Good in the bucket/Total Good)  - (Bad in bucket/Total bad))

IV = WOE ∗ (Percentage of the goof in the bucket - Percentage of the bad in the bucket)

It is an important indicator of predictive power.
