Let’s revise the concepts you have just learnt using the spam-ham example discussed earlier. Let’s define the events A and B as follows:

A: The email is spam

B: The email contains the word ‘viagra’

Now based on above definition solve the below questions:

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

QUESTION 1:

ANS:

Conditional probability

QUESTION 2:

Bayes Theorem and Its Building Blocks
What type of probability is ‘the probability that an email contains the word ‘viagra’ and it is spam’?

ANS:

Joint probability

What is the symbolic notation of conditional probability?

ANS:
