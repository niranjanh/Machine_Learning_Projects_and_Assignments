Comprehension: Naive Bayes With One Feature

Table 1: Mushroom Dataset with One Feature
S.No	Type of mushroom	Cap shape
1.	Poisonous		Convex
2.	Edible			Convex
3.	Poisonous		Convex
4.	Edible			Convex
5.	Edible			Convex
6.	Poisonous		Convex
7.	Edible			Bell
8.	Edible			Bell
9.	Edible			Convex
10.	Poisonous		Convex
11.	Edible			Flat
12.	Edible			Bell
 

Consider the table shown above.  There are two types of mushrooms, edible and poisonous, which is the target (dependent) variable.  They have various kinds of cap-shapes. Out of the total 12 mushrooms, eight are edible and four poisonous.

QUESTION 1:

Identifying the features
What is the feature in this task?

ANS:

Cap-Shape
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

QUESTION 2:

Probability calculation
The probability of a CONVEX mushroom being edible, P(C = edible | X = CONVEX) is given by:

ANS:

P( X = CONVEX | C = edible) . P(C = edible) / P(X = CONVEX)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

QUESTION 3:

Probability calculation
The value of P(C = edible) is simply the number of edible mushrooms in the dataset divided by the total observations. What is the value of P( C = edible)?

ANS:

8/12
Feedback :
P(edible) is the fraction of edible mushrooms in the data, which is 8/12.

QUESTION 4:

Probability calculation
Now letâ€™s say you picked a new mushroom whose cap-shape is CONVEX. What are the chances of this happening, i.e. what is the value of P(X = CONVEX)?

ANS:

8/12
Feedback :
P(X = CONVEX) is the fraction of convex mushrooms in the data. There are 8 convex mushrooms, thus it is 8/12.

QUESTION 5:

Probability calculation
What is the probability of the mushroom being CONVEX given it is edible, i.e. P(X = CONVEX | C = edible)? This is the fraction of CONVEX mushrooms out of all the edible ones.

ANS:

4/8
Feedback :
P(X = CONVEX | C = edible) means out of all the edible mushrooms, how many are CONVEX. Out of a total of 8 edible mushrooms, 4 are convex. Thus, it is 4/8.

QUESTION 6:

Probability calculation
In the previous questions, you have calculated that P(C = edible) is 8/12, P(X = CONVEX) is 8/12 and  P(X = CONVEX | C = edible) is 4/8.

What is the probability that the CONVEX mushroom is edible, P(C = edible | X = CONVEX)?

ANS:

4/8
Feedback :
P( X = CONVEX | C = edible) . P(C = edible) / P(X = CONVEX) = (4/8).(8/12) / (8/12) = 4/8.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


QUESTION 7:

Probability calculation
In the previous question, you found the probability of the CONVEX mushroom being edible. What is the probability of the CONVEX mushroom being poisonous, P(C = poisonous | X = CONVEX)?

ANS:

4/8
Feedback :
Since a mushroom can either be edible or poisonous, P(C = poisonous | X = CONVEX) is 1 - P(C = edible | X = CONVEX) = 1 - 4/8 = 4/8.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

QUESTION 8:

Probability calculation
What are the chances of a random mushroom being poisonous, i.e. P(C = poisonous)?

ANS:

4/12
Feedback :
There are 4 poisonous mushrooms out of 12.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

QUESTION 9:

Probability calculation
What are the chances of a mushroom being CONVEX given it is poisonous, i.e. P(X = CONVEX | C = poisonous)?

ANS:

1
Feedback :
P(X = CONVEX | C = poisonous) means out of all the poisonous mushrooms, how many are CONVEX. Out of the total 4 poisonous mushrooms, all the 4 are convex. Thus, it is 4/4.
