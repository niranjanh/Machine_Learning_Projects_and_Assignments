Bayes Theorem
A bag A contains 3 Red and 4 Green balls and another bag B contains 4 Red and 6 Green balls. One bag is selected at random and a ball is drawn from it. If the ball drawn is found Green , find the probability that the bag chosen was A.

ANS:

20/41

Step 1:

Let E1, E2 denote the events of selecting bag A and B respectively. 

Then P(E1) = P(E2) = 1/2.

 Let G denote the event that the ball chosen from the selected bag is Green.

Then we have to find P(E1/G).

Step 2:

By hypothesis P(G/E1) = 4/7 and  P(G/E2) = 6/10

By Bayes theorem P(E1/G) = (P(G/E1)*P(E1))/P(G)

 Now what is P(G) ?  P(G) = P(G,E1) + P(G,E2)

    = P(G/E1)P(E1) + P(G/E2)P(E2)

Therefore  P(E1/G) =  (P(G/E1)*P(E1))/P(G)

                    =P(G/E1)*P(E1)/P(E1)P(G/E1) + P(E2)P(G/E2)

=(4/7)x(1/2) / (1/2)x(4/7)+(1/2)x(6/10)=(4/14) / (4/14 + 6/20)=20/41

QUESTION 2:

Bayes Theorem
 

The bag A  contain 6 Green, 4 Blue ; B contains 4 Green, 6 Blue and C contains 5 Green, 5 Blue balls respectively. A bag is randomly selected  and a ball is drawn from it. If the ball drawn is Green, find the probability that it is drawn from bag A.

ANS:

2/5

Feedback :
 

Let EA, EB, EC and G be the events defined as follows:

EA =   Bag A is chosen, EB = Bag B is chosen,

EC = Bag C is chosen, and G= ball drawn is Green.

Step 1:

Since there are three bags and one of the three bags is chosen at random, therefore

P(EA) = P(EB) = P(EC) = 1/3

If EA is already occurred, then first bag has been chosen which contains 6 Green and 4 Black balls. The probability of drawing a green ball from it is 6/10.

So, P(G/EA) = 6/10

Similarly, we have P(G/EB) = 4/10  and P(G/EC) = 5/10

Step 2:

We are required to find P(EA/G) , i.e. given that the ball drawn is Green , what is the probability that it is drawn from bag A.

By Bayesâ€™ theorem, we have

P(EA/G) = P(G/EA)*P(EA)P(G)

Now what is P(G) ?  P(G) = P(G, EA ) + P(G,EB ) + P(G,EC)

= P(G/EA)P(EA) + P(G/EB)P(EB) + P(G/EC)P(EC)

Therefore P(EA/G) =(6/10)(1/3) / (1/3)(6/10) +(1/3)(4/10)+ (1/3)(5/10)=2/5
